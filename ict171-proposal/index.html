    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        For my ICT171 cloud deployment project, I have implemented a Linux-based web server hosted on Digital Ocean using the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model. The server runs Ubuntu with Nginx configured inside a Docker container to deliver static web content. droplet located in the Sydney data center, providing a reliable and cost-effective hosting environment for educational and small-scale professional projects.
        The web server hosts a custom-built static website designed to present my project proposal, server information, and licensing details. Using Docker allows for containerized isolation, making the deployment easier to manage, scale, and secure. The server firewall (UFW) is configured to restrict non-essential ports, minimizing the attack surface. Preparations are in place for SSL/TLS implementation to secure traffic via HTTPS using Certbot and Letâ€™s Encrypt.
        The project demonstrates key learning outcomes of ICT171, including provisioning a cloud-based Linux server, configuring web server software, deploying containerized applications, managing basic security controls, and understanding operational costs. This deployment remains online throughout the assessment period and uses a domain registered via NameSilo (quartzcs.com) to make the site publicly accessible. The setup enables easy future expansions, such as adding reverse proxies or scaling additional services, showing practical server administration skills.

    <h2>License Rationale</h2>
    <p>
        For this project, I have selected the MIT License for the website content and related server-side configurations. The MIT License is a highly permissive open-source license that allows others to freely use, copy, modify, and distribute the work, provided that the original copyright notice is included.
        This license promotes open collaboration and aligns with the educational goals of this deployment.
